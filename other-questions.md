# Git Commands
The purpose of this file is for you to demonstrate your knowledge of working with the terminal (because we can't otherwise know which commands you entered in the terminal). Think of it as a way to document the code that you used in the terminal to perform the assignment. Following each prompt below, write the line of code that you would (did) use on the terminal to accomplish the task. You can then use this file as a reference for your own work.

```bash
# Print your working directory
pwd
# List the files in your current directory
ls
# Change your directory to a folder in which you do work for this class
cd Info 201
# Clone your assignment repository from GitHub to your machine
git clone https://github.com/info-201a-sp21/a1-avaghela-1925502.git
# Using a *relative path*, change your directory to inside the repository you just cloned
cd a1-avaghela-1925502/
# Make a new folder called "imgs" - you'll download an image into this folder

# Add all of your changes that you've made to git

# Make a commit of your changes, including a descriptive message

# Push your change up to GitHub

```
