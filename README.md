# a1-news

In this assignment, you'll edit this `README.md` file to create a Markdown document that describes a news story (full instructions on Canvas). You'll also answer questions, mostly about how to use the terminal in the `other-questions.md` file: **don't forget** to complete the instructions in that file!

To perform the instructions on Canvas, you should **delete this text**, leaving only the Markdown that you've written to render your news page. Make sure to **submit this GitHub URL** to Canvas on time for full credit.
