# Walt Disney World Loosens Mask Mandate

The Walt Disney World in Florida is now allowing guests to take pictures outdoors **without a mask** on starting *April 8th*. While they are still required to keep the masks on indoors, Walt Disney World has now started to loosen up on the mask policy. After already allowing people to *eat and drink with their masks off*, Walt Disney World continues to try and make the experience more enjoyable for their customers. **Disneyland Resort** in California is also set to reopen on *April 30th* after a year-long closure.

>Florida does not have a statewide mask mandate, but there are mask orders in effect in Orange and Osceola counties, where Walt Disney World is located.
